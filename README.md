# EnergiCore React App

This project is designed to collect data using EnergiCore

## How it works

The app fetches data from EnergiCore's mainnet.
It collects data from the latest block.

It uses EnergiCore's package [@energi/web3-ext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@energi/web3-ext)

Data is mapped to a Block model that the app passes to the view.
